This project was done while I was learning Pandas for data analytics. I found this youtube channel ("Data Thinkers") that helped me to train more my habilities with this library on different projects.
In this starting project we review the very basics of pandas in order to check basic information of a dataset about e-commerce purchases such as: if there is null values, column names, counting the values of data, etc.

Here is the link of the project video:
