# Data Jobs Survey Analysis (PP)

### Project Overview
This dashboard was designed to provide insights from a survey made to people in different countries about key facts of their jobs focused on data (analysts, scientists, engineers, etc). These questions are about the most important things they look for in a job, their salaries, the industries they work in, whether they changed their carreer to data, etc.

### Data Sources
The data source used is the file "Power BI - Final Project.xlsx" provided by the ycontent creator "Alex the Analyst" in his video he creates a dashboard as a final project for his PBI course, I used the dataset he brang to create my own dashboard.

### Tools Used
- Excel -Data Cleaning and homologation
- Microsoft Power BI - Creating Dashboard Report and create conditional column for age classification

### Data Cleaning and Preparation
On the initial data preparation phase, I performed the following tasks:
1. Data inspection
2. Data Cleaning and homologation
3. Eliminating columns and making age conditional column

### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involved exploring the answers given in the survey to resposes to answer key questions such as:
- What is the number of people surveyed?
- What is the genre and age of the people surveyed?
- What country are they from?
- What is their level of education?
- What are the most important things they are looking for in a job?
- What's their favorite programming language?
- Percentage of the people who have changed carreers and the industry they are working in

### Findings.
The main findings can be summarized as follows:
- The number of people surveyed was 630 divided into 468 man and 162 women.
- Most of the people surveyed are young adults (25-39 years old).
- 59.05% of the people changed their carreers into data and they find more difficult to learn to program than the people who didn't changed their carrer.
- 41.43% of the people are from USA.
- The most popular and favorite programming language by far is Python.
- Top 3 working industries: Tech, Finance and Healthcare
- Top 3 most important things the workers are looking for in a job are: Better Salary, Remote Work and Good Work/Life Balance
- Bachelors and Masters degree are the highest levels of education.
- 65.4% of the people are Data Analysts

### Limitations
- The dataset received some null answers about their job title and levels of education.
- The answers were not homologated enough to get the most accurate answers from the people as most of the answers were made by themselves from the "other" option of the questions.
