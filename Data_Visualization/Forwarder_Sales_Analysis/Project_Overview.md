### Project Overview
This data analysis dashboard aims to provide insights about a forwarder's sales performance, Top routes, profit and volume per month. By analyzing these aspects of the data, we seek to identify trends per month through the years, make data driven decisions for our contract negotiations and gain a deeper understanding of the customers volume and profit performance.


### Data Sources
The data source used is the file "Clientes.xlsx". Because of Company's confidential terms, the real customer names had to be changed into fake ones, such as the P/L (profit/loss) had to be changed. The routes and carrier used per shipment kept as the real database.

### Tools Used
- Excel -Data Cleaning, Data Base Build Up
- Microsoft Power BI - Creating Dashboard Report

On the initial data preparation phase, I performed the following tasks:
1. Data inspection
2. Data Cleaning and homologation
3. Data base building (Creating the primary keys, with customer and carrier's names homologated. Ports database was built before considering our carrier's contracts, cleaning and homologation was done already)
