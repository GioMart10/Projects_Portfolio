# Appstore Analysis Project (LP)

## Project Overview
This project was made while I was studying SQL in order to improve my SQL query intuition and correct statements use. The dataset contains info about 7200 apps from Apple's appstore such as genre, user rating, version, name and if is a free app or paid

## Data Sources
The data used was downloaded directly from kaggle's "Mobile App Store (7200 apps)" datasets, here is the link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ramamet4/app-store-apple-data-set-10k-apps?select=appleStore_description.csv

## Tools Used
- SQLite: Data Querying for learning purposes

## Data Cleaning and Preparation
The dataset was already cleaned and homologated to start querying.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involved on this project was about practicing the lenguage to answer questions of the database such as:
- Are there missing values in key fields?
- How many apps per genre has the dataset?
- Paid apps have better ratings than free ones?
- What are the genres with lowest and highest ratings?
- What is the top rated App for each genre?

## Findings
The main results can be summarized as follows:
- The most
## Limitations
- Although the datasets were considering data from an App Store, it was missing key info about downloads number per app.
