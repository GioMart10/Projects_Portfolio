# Projects_Portfolio
## Index
This repository contains all the projects I , these will be referred as "PP". The projects done while I was learning to code will be referred as "LP". Currently I binned my projects in three different categories:
1. Python
   * Data Analytics
   * Machine Learning
2. Data Visualization
   * PowerBI
3. SQL projects

Some projects could combine 2 categories (Ex. SQL with PowerBI) In those cases the respective file or code will be found in the category with a link to the second category in case you want to know more about it, look for the code I used an insights worked or just download the csv file used in the project.
